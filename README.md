Team,
 
Our customers count on us every day to deliver world-class products and services that will enable their transformation in the digital economy. As part of our path to growth, I’m pleased to introduce an improved process designed to transform how we deliver our Professional, Integration, Life cycle and all custom labor Services end-to-end.  In collaboration with our Business Transformation team; and under the leadership of Mike Bickel and Arun Kundu, we are rolling out this new initiative over the course of the next few weeks.
 
Today, our current service delivery model for custom labor Services involves four different processes which have created a fragmented customer experience. We are collapsing those disjointed processes into one simplified standard delivery model that we will leverage globally. 
 
Again, this new and improved process only applies to our Professional, Integration, Life cycle and custom labor Services.  Our standard labor services which are normally included in the price of a product we sell are not impacted. 
 
Here’s how our stakeholders will benefit.
 
•	Our Employees: Enable one quote, one contract, and one bill for all custom labor Services proposed and ordered, driving out variability, confusion, and inconsistent processes that currently exist. 
•	Our Customers: Deliver faster quotes in a common format, a simple contract, a clear bill and coordinated delivery.
•	Our business: Improve our reporting capabilities and ultimately drive revenue growth and profitability –better positioning VES in a very competitive global market.
 
Now that’s positive change!
 
So what’s next? 
The first phase goes live on July 17.  If this initiative changes your day-to-day work activities, you will receive information about training and support in the coming days.  Be sure to complete your role-specific training before July 17th, as opportunities will begin routing in a new way on that date.  
 
Additional communication will be provided to keep you updated along the way.  You’ll also have the opportunity to obtain additional information from CrowdAround.  
 
I look forward to your continued support and efforts as we drive this change forward.
 
George

http://itext.2136553.n4.nabble.com/Luna-SA-HSM-Integration-with-iTextSharp-td2552278.html

For the sake of closure and perhaps saving someone else from running off on the same wild goose chase in the future, I thought I would post an update here. 

The issue was related to my own lack of understanding of the Luna SA HSM.  The setup instructions with the device included generation of a client certificate that was then installed on the HSM.  I took this to mean that the client certificate that was generated as part of that process was in fact the certificate I would be using for signing. 

After speaking with SafeNet support, I discovered that the client certificate referred to in the documentation was not for general use and was related to establishing the secure trusted relationship between the HSM and my computer. 

Once I realized this, I was able to generate a test self-signed certificate using makecert and just specifying the correct parameters: 

        makecert -sk keyContainerName -sp "Luna Cryptographic Services for Microsoft Windows" -sy 1, -r -n "CN=issuer" -ss my test.cer 

Once this was done, I had a certificate in the "My" store that essentially contained pointers to the keys stored on the HSM.  I was then able to use the example code to quickly have success in signing the PDF. 

Another case of an early misunderstanding leading to over-thinking and over-engineering (that in this case still didn't end up working).  In reality, this integration is pretty straight forward.  I'm including the sample C# code that I have working for signing a PDF using the Luna HSM below. Thanks to all of you that responded.
